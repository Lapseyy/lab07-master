## Getting Started
1. Setting Up Python Environment

     - Verify Python Installation:
     - Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux).
     - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
     - You should see the installed Python version displayed.

2. Configuring Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

     - Install Python Extension:
     - Open VS Code.
     - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
     - Search for `Python` in the Extensions Marketplace.
     - Click “Install” on the Python extension by Microsoft.

3. Running Python in VS Code

     - Create a New Python File:
     - In VS Code, open a folder where you want to save your Python projects.
     - Click on File > New File or press Ctrl+N to create a new file.
     - Save the file with a .py extension (e.g., `hello.py`).
    
## Program Instructions
1. Write a Python program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Contact List which contains a dictionary of contacts that is stored on the hard drive and that can have contacts added, modified, or deleted.
1. Create a `contacts` module to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `contacts.py`.
          1. Define a class named `Contacts`.  
               1. Define a member function named `__init__` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    2. Take a `filename` as a keyword parameter.
                    3. Set a member variable equal to the filename.
                    4. Set a member varialbe equal to an empty data dictionary.
                    5. Open the filename and load the JSON decoded contents to the empty data dictionary.
                    6. Cleanly manage the `FileNotFoundError` if the filename does not exist.
               1. Define a member function named `add_contact` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    2. If the id exists in the data dictionary, return the string `error`.
                    3. Set the id:[first_name, last_name] key:value pair to the data dictionary.
                    4. Sort the data dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
                    5. Write the contents of the data dictionary to the filename that was set to the member variable.
                    6. Return the key:value pair that was added.
               1. Define a member function named `modify_contact` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
                    1. Set the id:[first_name, last_name'] key:value pair to the contact dictionary.
                    4. Sort the data dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
                    5. Write the contents of the data dictionary to the filename that was set to the member variable.
                    6. Return the key:value pair that was modified.
               1. Define a member function named `delete_contact` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
                    2. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
                    3. Remove the key:value pair with the key equal to id.
                    5. Write the contents of the data dictionary to the filename that was set to the member variable.

1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.
    
    For Linux and Mac users
    ```
    ./test.sh or source ./test.sh
    ```
       
    For windows users
    ```
    ./win_test.bat
    ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run `./test.sh` or `./win_test.bat` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission

Submit a zip file containing all the code files on canvas 

Naming Convention: <CWID>_<LastName>.zip    

Your zipped folder should contain below files:
```
CWID_LASTNAME.zip -
                  | > test.py
                  | > test.sh
                  | > main.py
                  | > contacts.py
                  | > test.txt
                  | > win_test.bat
```
